\section{Theorem: N-Way Splay Tree Delete Complexity}

\textbf{Statement:} Deleting from an N-way splay tree with $n$ nodes takes $O(\log n)$ amortized time.

\section{Proof}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Splay node to root: $O(\log n)$ amortized
    \item Delete root: $O(1)$
    \item If needed, splay successor/predecessor: $O(\log n)$ amortized
    \item Total: $O(\log n)$ amortized
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Conclusion:} N-way splay tree delete has $O(\log n)$ amortized time complexity.
